# Mental Health research

This repository contains my research on the mental health issues survey dataset 
(https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey). 
In this research some correlations are found and 2 models are trained to predict,
 whether a human should seek treatment for a mental health condition or not.

The survey addresses following issues:
---

Random forests' results
---

After preparing data and greed search on parameters 'n_estimators', 'criterion', 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf'
 for RandomForestClassifier (sklearn), obtained
 
*  0.80% accuracy

with best parameters:

* 'criterion': 'entropy',
*  'max_depth': 15,
*  'min_samples_leaf': 3,
 * 'n_estimators': 64.
